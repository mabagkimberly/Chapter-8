*Creating Apps Navigation 

I learned how to navigate between pages using the Navigator widget, allowing me to push and pop screens. Hero animations were introduced, enabling smooth transitions as widgets appear to fly into place across pages. I also discovered how to create a BottomNavigationBar with both icons and titles for a clean navigation experience at the bottom of the screen. The BottomAppBar enhanced the appearance of the navigation bar, especially with its notch feature for added design flair. I explored the TabBar widget, which displays a row of horizontal tabs, and paired it with TabBarView to dynamically display content based on the selected tab. The Drawer widget provided a slide-out panel from the side for easier navigation options, and I learned how to quickly build lists using ListView, both for basic items and within the Drawer for a menu layout.
